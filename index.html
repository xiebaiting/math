  <h1>Now</h1>

  <p>2023-10-5 <br>I'm working on dessins d'enfants, especially convexly triangulated spheres.
    I'm interested in their fields of definite and some related counting problems.
    And I'm learning something about elliptic curves, modular forms and elliptic integrals since they can be viewed as a special case of the above problem.</p>
